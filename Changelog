# Version 2.0.2

New features
  - Support rename command in config file (#272)
  - Support transaction (#285)
    Support MULTI, EXEC, DISCARD command, but don't support
    WATCH and UNWATCH commands.
  - Support the auto-resize-block-and-sst config directive (#289)
  - Support to resize rocksdb.block_size automatically (#294)
  - Support cluster mode (#302)
    Similar with redis cluster mode, use CLUSTERX command to set
    cluster topology (#324).

Data encoding changes
  - Encode key with slot id (#291) (#330)
    In cluster mode, to be efficient to migrate keys by slot when scale,
    we encode key with slot id, but in standalone mode, we don't. That is
    to say, data is not compatible between standalone mode with cluster mode,
    you must migrate data if you want to change mode, otherwise, kvrocks
    will make data corrupt.

Bugfixes
  - Set TCP_KEEPALIVE for replication connection (#284)
    Replicas can handle network failure with master, before this commit,
    network failure may result in unrecoverable replication interrupt.
  - Fix ZSET can't add the same member with different scores (#298)
  - Make CONFIG SET command thread safe (#310)
  - Fix LTRIM only delete first item, LREM can't correctly remove
    repeated items (#314)

Improvements
  - HSET command supports to set multiple fields (#274)
  - Allow to use host in the master-slave replication (#301)
  - Adapt redis sentinel ping check (#316)


# Version 2.0.1

New features
  - Support COMMAND command (#251)
  - Support to purge backups on fullsync to reduce disk space usage (#245)

Bugfixes
  - Fix uninitialized Rocksdb.level0_stop_writes_trigger (#236)
  - Fix condition race for ReclaimOldDBPtr (#246)
  - Fix data race for accessing database in some commands (#253) (#261)
    In spop, zremrangebylex, zremrangebyscore commands, the lock guard
    for accessing the database may not work actually.
  - Fix returning wrong string range in GETRANGE command (#254)
  - Fix skipping wrong CURRENT file when full synchronization (#260)
    Resuming broken transfer based files may be not available if replicas
    skip transfered wrong CURRENT file of RocksDB.

Improvements
  - Replicas can execute publish command (#238)
  - Optimizations for avoiding unnecessary data copy (#239) (#247)
  - Allow to run the kvrocks without assigning the config file (#264)

Dependencies
  - Upgrade the jemalloc version to the special commit (#265)
    To be able to compile on macOS, upgrade jemalloc to the production
    test commit which mentioned in jemalloc/jemalloc#2060.


# Version 2.0.0

New features
  - Don't use extra port for replication (#200)
  - Use checkpoint to implement data snapshot when full replication (#208)
    Reduce disk space and bandwidth usage and decrease the time of replicas
    recovery during full synchronization.
  - Use checkpoint to implement kvrocks backup (#232)
  - Replicas can empty db before fullsync (#233)
    Replicas use less disks space if enabled, but have a risk to lose data.

Command changes
  - Add QPS and input/output kbps for INFO command (#213)
  - Add pubsub_patterns for INFO command (#234)
  - Slowlog omits args or argument string if too many or big (#215)

Cluster

    From now, we doesn't support codis, you can adopt pre-sharding to implement
    cluster, and we are developing new cluster solution that is similar with
    redis cluster mode, please see #219.
